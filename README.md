# Cloris NFT Token

Here are my study notes for the NFT Token Project

1) What is Cloris?
 <br>Cloris is a Non-fungible Token comliant with the ERC721 standard.
 <br>The Cloris smart contract is deployed on the Rinkeby Test network, and need a Metamask wallet to be purchased.
 <br>Since Cloris is deployed on a test network, you can acquire Ether for free by finding a Rinkeby Faucet such as: https://rinkebyfaucet.com/	
 <br>Once your Metamask wallet has Ether, you can Cloris Tokens by going to https://cloris.surge.sh/
 <br>You can then see your purchased Token on Etherscan https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/		
 <br>You acquire up to 3 Cloris token to your wallet.
 

2) What problems needed to be overcome to create Cloris?
 <br>The first challenge was to create those 1000 images on a computer without crashing the system while using the less amount of time and space as possible.
 <br>The second challenge was to store the pictures and their respective metadata on a decentralised platform. The Cloris project used Pinata and IPFS to store the 1000 pictures and their respective Metadata.
 <br>The third challenge was to format the Metadata in a way that is compatible with OpenSea API.
 
 
 3) What is next for the Cloris Project?
   - Increase the amount of generated images from 1000 to 100000.
   - Improve the NFT art style
   - Deploy the Cloris NFT smart contract on the mainnet
