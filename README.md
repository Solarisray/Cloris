# Cloris NFT Token

Here are my study notes for the NFT Token Project

1) What is Cloris?
	Cloris is a Non-fungible Token comliant with the ERC721 standard.
 The Cloris smart contract is deployed on the Rinkeby Test network, and need a Metamask wallet to be purchased.
	
 Since Cloris is deployed on a test network, you can acquire ether for free by finding a Rinkeby Faucet such as:	
				https://rinkebyfaucet.com/
				
 Once your Metamask wallet has ether, you can go on OpenSea on the Rinkeby test Network to find the Cloris project.
    https://testnets.opensea.io/collection/cloris
				
 You acquire up to 3 Cloris token to your wallet.
 

2) What problems needed to be overcome to create Cloris?
 To create this NFT project, 1000 images needed to be created. 
 The first challenge was to create those 1000 images on a computer without crashing the system while using the less amount of time and space as possible.
 The second challenge was to store the pictures and their respective metadata on a decentralised platform.
   The Cloris project used Pinata and IPFS to store the 1000 pictures and their respective Metadata.
 The third challenge was to format the Metadata in a way that is compatible with OpenSea API.
 
 
 3) What is next for the Cloris Project?
  Potential improvement:
   - Increase the amount of generated images from 1000 to 100000.
   - Improve the NFT art style
   - Deploy the Cloris NFT smart contract on the mainnet
